Ever since I started college, I’ve been one of just a few women in a room full of men. To be perfectly honest, this has never bothered me. I didn’t realize I was a woman in tech, because I just viewed myself as a person in tech. It may sound ridiculous or naive, but I thought that since I saw all of my classmates and colleagues as genderless, they saw me as a genderless equal. And since this was my perspective, it must be the same perspective that every woman in tech has, right? </p>\n<p>Sadly, because this was my view of the world, I avoided getting involved in any discussions about the gender gap in the STEM fields and the discrimination that women (especially mothers) receive when it comes to promotions in the tech sector. I could avoid those conversations all I wanted, because, well, it wasn’t happening to me. This avoidance of “taboo work topics” means I was/am actually part of the problem. </p>\n<p>We do have a problem though. Women are underrepresented in the tech sector by a margin of 3 to 1 and have an attrition rate nearly twice as high as men. There are many articles about the numbers on women in tech, but this WIRED article does a decent job summing it up: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/five-years-tech-diversity-reports-little-progress/\">https://www.wired.com/story/five-years-tech-diversity-reports-little-progress/</a></p>\n<p>To be honest though, I didn’t need an article to tell me that there are not an equal amount of women in tech, I witness it every day. For me, the disheartening part about these numbers is that some of the most impressive developers and leaders that I’ve worked with in tech have been women. It's terrible to think that we could lose that talent because they decide this industry isn't a good fit. Over the last few months, I’ve been seeking out answers to these statistics and why they matter. Spoiler: I don’t have all of them, but below is a list of a few things that I've learned.</p>\n<p>Caroline Criado Perez explains in her book “Invisible Women“ that as we increase our reliance on artificial intelligence, it is absolutely necessary to have a diverse group of people developing the algorithms. One case she cited which was particularly eye-opening was a hiring algorithm a tech company used to narrow their applicant candidate pool. This particular model would explore an applicant’s online activity for updates to their personal Github repository or contributions to Stack Overflow, which the developers felt was a strong indicator of coding interest and skill. Unfortunately, a lot of recent studies show that women are doing more unpaid labor than men (household chores, childcare, elderly care); therefore, women may not have the same spare time as men to be active in those forums during their non-work hours. Additionally, she mentions that women typically show their love for coding in different ways. Personally, I don't contribute to these forums outside of work. I am much more inclined to attend meetups to collaborate with others, read a book/article about a new technology, or take a class. By basing part of the algorithm on specific activities done during non-work hours, it had a hidden bias to recommend hiring men. Perez’s argument is that if women are more involved in developing algorithms like these, hidden biases will come to light much sooner. </p>\n<p>This example obviously doesn’t explain why the number of women in the tech sector is low (the number of women choosing computer science in college is low in the first place). However, this example showed me why I shouldn’t be ok with the gender gap just being the way that it is. One of the reasons we need to increase the number of women in tech is because machine learning algorithms do not currently have the necessary gender disaggregated data for robust algorithms which account for differences between males and females. As more and more things are becoming automated, a lack of diversity in groups of developers could unknowingly increase biases that affect more than just the tech sector. </p>\n<p>Moving on to attrition. As I’ve been reading about this topic, one thing that came to mind was the “always-on” mentality. This mentality of always being available outside of work hours is prevalent in the tech sector and to be perfectly honest I'm a part of this problem. Too many developers have their work email and chat tools available on their phones, or work remotely into the wee hours of the night tying up that last bit of code and answering questions when they are “clocked out”. This culture particularly disadvantages caregivers who simply cannot maintain a work presence while caring for a child or aging parent during non-work hours. I know these statements apply to fathers as well, which is why the attrition rate of new fathers in the tech industry is also high. As an industry, we need to start promoting policies that enhance work-life balance instead of prevent it so that people in all walks of life can excel in this industry. </p>\n<p>These two issues are a big deal, but they are probably just a very small piece of the big picture. With this new insight though, I’ve finally opened my eyes and realized that I am a woman in tech. That doesn’t mean that I am any better or worse than men in tech, but it does mean that I am different. I have a different perspective, different biases, and different tendencies. These differences are valuable.</p>\n<p>So if you’re a girl who is deciding if you want to go into tech or choose computer science in school, I hope you hear this. Your insight, perspective, and ideas are needed. You belong here. You can excel here. And if you’re a woman currently in the tech industry and are thinking about leaving, please know that great tech companies who value women’s contributions and understand that women’s needs are different do exist. If you are in a workplace that doesn’t encourage good work-life balance, or continuously promotes men over women, join meetup groups and talk to other women in tech about it. Hopefully they can lead you to a place that works better for you. </p>\n<p>I’m finally ready to be part of the conversation, part of the solution. I’m finally ready to get involved in the community. I finally have an opinion and no longer feel ok ignoring it. So what do I do now?</p>\n<p>The phrase “you can’t be what you can’t see” has really stuck with me this year. I've started making time to participate in activities that help girls in middle school and high school see the exciting and important technological advances that women are making. Getting girls interested in STEM at a young age and keeping them interested through high school is one way I would love to help address the shortage of women in all STEM fields. I'm also looking for groups in the Omaha/Lincoln area advocating for reducing the gender gap in tech. If you know of any groups or activities like these that are seeking new people, I would love to hear about them. Thanks for listening.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20200214-realizing-i-am-a-woman-in-tech"}},"staticQueryHashes":["176528973","2358152166","2561578252","2731221146","4145280475"]}
