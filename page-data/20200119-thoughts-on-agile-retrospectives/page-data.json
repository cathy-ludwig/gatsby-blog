It's a common theme these days. Scrum masters are having a hard time getting their team to speak up during retro so they feel a fun game will get them talking. </p>\n<p>An Agile retrospective aims to answer the following open-ended questions: what went well (and why?), what didn’t go well (and why?), and how can we do better next sprint. It’s an opportunity for feedback, connection, and improvement as a team. Retro is by far my favorite agile ceremony. I love that while other sprintly meetings are focused on “what we are doing”, this meeting is ultimately focused on “how we are doing”. Isn’t that alone enough fun for everyone to get fully engaged? Unfortunately, for me, retro loses its luster when people try to make it fun with games that have nothing to do with our evaluation of the sprint. Don’t get me wrong, I love games and I love socializing with my team, but not when we’re trying to figure out ways to improve our team processes.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the biggest issues with using games to make retrospectives “fun”.</p>\n<p>No applicability. Most of the games that people play for retro have absolutely nothing to do with their own team, their own experiences, or their particular challenges. If the goal is continuous improvement of their team’s processes, they can’t possibly figure that out while solving a murder mystery or deciding which Disney princess they felt like last sprint.\nNo focus. Once people are playing a game, it’s natural to start joking around and having fun with each other. In my opinion, this meeting requires a fairly high level of seriousness and thoughtfulness. If it’s just a big recess, how can anyone be expected to quickly shift gears to come up with big solutions to some of their team's biggest problems?\nNo collaboration. One of the things that I find with game style retrospectives is that it doesn’t actually bring the team together (other than socially). People can have fun playing a game together, but then still hate working with each other. It takes real honest feedback, accountability, and teamwork to successfully tackle big work projects together. Becoming a great team is not something that happens by simply being friendly with each other for an hour per sprint.\nSo why are people resorting to retrospective games? The answer to this question still escapes me. Is it because people think that nothing valuable is coming from the meeting (which I would argue is exactly the effect games have on this meeting)? Is it because phones are distracting people in a meeting which requires full engagement? Is it because no one comes prepared? No matter why people are not engaged, I don’t think games solve the problem.</p>\n<p>What are some ways that a scrum master can facilitate an engaging and effective retrospective without resorting to games?</p>\n<p>Make sure people come prepared. Walk around to your team about 15 minutes before retrospective and ask them to write down their answers to your retrospective questions. Speaking from experience, it is much easier to reflect on the sprint quietly at my desk than it is on-the-fly when people are already talking in the meeting.\nMake the meeting a safe space. I know this is sometimes easier said than done. It’s important to make sure that all team members feel like their opinion matters, and that no one calls out a team member in a destructive manner. If someone wants to hold a teammate accountable, make sure that they offer constructive suggestions of how the rest of the team can help the poor-performer improve. Try to guide individuals to take team ownership instead of individual ownership of deficiencies and successes.\nAsk more questions that are specific to your team. Asking the same old questions can get dry. You get a lot more engagement if you start with the main retro open-ended questions and then dig deeper to uncover what was unique about this sprint to this team.\nAs a team, commit to your actions. A retrospective is not very effective if you come to the same meeting sprint after sprint and say the same thing each time. Find a way that works for your team to focus on each action item so you are living the motto of continuous improvement.\nI hope that everyone has found or can find a way to make their retrospective engaging, because there is so much value that comes from a retro when everyone on the team is contributing. </p>\n<p>What do you think? Do retrospectives need to be fun? Can they be fun without games?</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20200119-thoughts-on-agile-retrospectives"}},"staticQueryHashes":["176528973","2358152166","2561578252","2731221146","4145280475"]}
