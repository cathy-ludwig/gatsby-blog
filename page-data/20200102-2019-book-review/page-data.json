While sometimes it seems to drag on, it flies by when I listen to a truly phenomenal book. This past year I made it through 19 books (huh, I just noticed that I read as many books as the year). That is not intended to be a humble brag, I want to give you some assurance that these were not the only books that I read. These were the ones that I want to read again, probably multiple times more.</p>\n<p>Typically, I'll read a fairly even mix of fiction and nonfiction, but this year was different. I've been doing a lot of self-reflection, so I was looking for books that would truly inspire, motivate, and provoke thought for me. Pretty much all 19 books had something to do with self-improvement or awareness, and these were by far the best!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Moment of Lift by Melinda Gates</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This book has easily become one of my all-time favorites, and I highly recommend it to everyone! I honestly had no idea what to expect when I started this book. I didn't listen to the preview, I just went for it. Part of me doesn't want to share the summary with you so you get to experience the same eye-opening feeling that I did, but I have to share something.</p>\n<p>Melinda Gates delivered a book that awoke in me a feeling of drive to get out there and contribute more to this world. Sometimes I get so lost in the busyness of the day-to-day that I forget there is a bigger world than what is in my immediate field of vision. This book brought the big issues of the world to me in a very real way. She outlined the work that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation does and I realized that it is some of the most important, inspiring work in the world today. The overarching theme is that lifting up women truly helps lift up a society. Her approach is research-based and she has an incredible way of tying in the most relevant, emotional stories to demonstrate how simple some of the most impactful change can be.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Dare to Lead by Brene Brown</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Brene Brown revealed the power of vulnerability and daring leadership with this one. I have not read any of her other books, so I know I'm behind the curve. She provided a great outline for how leaders can connect with everyone in their organization in a genuine and effective way. Empathy has always been a struggle for me, but this book relayed the power of empathy in an organization and actual steps you can take to learn to be genuinely empathetic when someone needs you. This guidebook also addressed bravery, trust, and values in a way that will improve the way you lead. The older I get, the more I realize that soft skills are more important and harder to learn than technical skills. The keys to organizational soft skill development awaits you in Dare to Lead.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The Infinite Game by Simon Sinek</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a business owner, this one hits home. Simon Sinek laid out the reasons that most companies fail. It's not the obvious reasons like a bad product line or overspending. It is leaders who fail to lead with an infinite mindset and companies without a Just Cause. He uses many examples from relevant large companies to prove the point, and I must say, the evidence is quite convincing. It gets to the heart of what motivates people to work hard for a company and what motivates people to buy a company's product.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Loving What Is by Byron Katie</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'll be honest, I haven't finished this book just yet. However, I can tell that it belongs on this list. Byron Katie proposes that our suffering doesn't come from the problems in our life (that we believe are causing our suffering), it comes from our thoughts about those problems. She challenges us to see the truth in any situation by asking four simple questions which she calls The Work. It seems like a guidebook to letting stress go and learning that you can choose peace. Looking forward to trying it out once I finish the book.</p>\n<p>Well, that is my list. It has been my favorite year of audiobooks yet. If you are looking for a good read in 2020, maybe one of these books can inspire you too. Now, what should I read next?</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20200102-2019-book-review"}},"staticQueryHashes":["176528973","2358152166","2561578252","2731221146","4145280475"]}
